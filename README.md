# Flower-Classification
In this project, an image classifier is trained to recognize different species of flowers

## Developing an AI application

Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

### Model used

### How to improve results

Even thoght, densenet121 model shows a good performance we can still try to adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate or introduce momentum to the model. One can try to use different normalization parameters such as mean and stdandard devioation. Moreoverm, the classifier architecture can be changed.
